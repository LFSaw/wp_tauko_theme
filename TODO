* General
** Fill in TODO and README
** General cleanups (so everything doesn't seem so code-n-run)
** Create 404-page (404.php)
** Create image sizes for lightbox images.
** The way the home icon is added has a kind of hackish feel to it.
** More consistent way of using echo "<html>"; and <a href="<?php test();?>">
** There is no error logging anywhere.
* page_priority
** Create an admin view for better page_priority management
** Remove redundant/pointless _page_priority attribute, and use only menu_order
* js
** Do we really need to include jquery by ourselves? Does wp provide some way to do that?
** Move isotope reload/redraw function to its own javascript file
* css
** Move isotope css to its own file.
** Maybe remove style_mobile? Or at the very least, gather all common css to style.css file.
* page_color
** Verify user input when color is added
** Add somekind of heuristic to page_color_alt_shade() so that it can dedice wether to darken or lighten the shade. Or maybe a parameter option.
* boxes
** DONE - tauko_boxes() is pointless/harmful.
* page-templates
** Content grids
*** Content grids are redundant (basically the same thing is written twice, with minor variations). Should make the text box visibility controlled by a variable, and then just toggle that variable for gallery + text.
*** Content grids are horribly code-n-run.
